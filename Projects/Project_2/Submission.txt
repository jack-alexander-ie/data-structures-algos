Answer all 6 problems listed in the previous concepts.

Code solutions must be in a separate file like "problem_1.py" - upload answers in a single .zip file

All solutions should be functions named as laid out in the concepts. Feel free to make additional helper functions or classes as needed.

Test Cases:

    At least 3 test cases for each solution.
    Write the function call with the input you want to test and print it to the console.
    On the next line, comment out the output you expect to see from that function call.

Explanation:

    Explanation for each question in a single separate PDF called "explanation_1.pdf".
    Paragraph should provide reasoning behind decisions, not a walkthrough e.g.:

        Why use that data structure?
        What is the time complexity?
        What is the space complexity?

Compress your one Python and one text file into a .zip, and submit.

Note: Time complexity for reading the input will not be considered in the overall complexity of the solution.
