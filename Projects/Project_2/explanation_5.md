# Problem 5 - Blockchain

The solution for this problem was implemented using customised nodes and linked lists.

Nodes are the most appropriate structures to use to create blocks in a chain as they must contain a variety of data and 
other data structures. They can also be hashed and linked to one another as part of a chain, two vital features of 
blockchain blocks.

Linked lists are used in blockchain technology so that a chain of accountability and security can be maintained. What 
linked lists offer over other data structures is the immutability of the block linking.

### Time Complexity

The worst case scenario for the initialisation of a blockchain and the addition of a new block to an existing chain is 
O(1).

The worst case scenario for the implementation of a blockchain is O(n). This is as this is the number of block which 
have to be added to the chain.

Furthermore, the printing of the blockchain could also be considered to be O(n) as it has to print the info from all 
blocks in the chain.

## Conclusion

Time Complexity: O(n)
