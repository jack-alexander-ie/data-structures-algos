# Problem 6 - Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this algorithm is `O(n)` as it cycles through all the elements in the list just one time.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity for this algorithm is `O(1)` as it simply cycles through the list it was given, and creates only
a small, fixed number of variables to track the min and max numbers.

## Conclusion

Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Space Complexity: `O(1)`
