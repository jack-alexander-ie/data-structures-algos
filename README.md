# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repo contains a collection of files I'll be generating while studying the Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree.

It will contain a variety of things I am learning, along with the various projects I have to submit.

The course material can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).

Topics it covers include:

* Data Structures: Linked Lists, Trees, Arrays, Stacks, Hash Tables
* Algorithms: Recursion, Binary Search, Sorting, Divide & Conquer, Greedy, Graph, Dynamic Programming, Linear Programming

The aim of taking this course is to backfill knowledge gaps so that I can start contributing to Open Source projects.
